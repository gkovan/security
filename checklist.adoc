= Security Checklist
:reproducible:

This document contains a security checklist.

== General Security Principles

* Least privilege access
** Identities are only permitted to perform the most minimal set of functions necessary to fulfill a specific task
* Zero trust security
** Application components including microservices are considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice trusts any other
* Defense in depth
** Multiple layers of of security controls are implemented thoughout the system to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited
* Identity foundation for both humans and machines
** TODO - ### description ###

== Account Management ( Cloud Privider)

TBD

== Identity Management (Cloud Platform)

* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per pyhisical person
* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per application
* [ ] One IAM Role per Application
* [ ] IAM credentials are not shared
* [ ] IAM credentials are not in code 
* [ ] ROOT account not used except for initial account setup
* [ ] ROOT IAM Credentials not used
*	[ ] Strong sign in mechanisms
** [ ] MFA (multi factor authentication) 
* [ ] Use temporary (short lived) credentials when appropriate
** Some examples of when this would be appropriate are:
*** Enterprise Identity Federation
***	Web identity federation
*** Cross account access
* [ ] Rotate credentials periodically
** [ ] For human identities, change passwords periodically 
** [ ] Use temporary credentials when possible instead of access keys
** [ ] For machine identities, use temporary credentials using IAM roles
* [ ] Store and use secrets securely

== Identity Management ( OpenShift)
* [ ] Configure an identity provider
* [ ] Create a cluster admin user
* [ ] Remove kubeadmin user (default OpenShift cluster admin user)
* [ ] One serviceaccount per application
* [ ] default service account is not used

== Permission Management

Enforce least privelage access

* [ ] Identity base policies are specified

* [*] checked
** [ ] also checked
* [ ] not checked
* [ ] test test


Note:

Cloud Platforms are IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, GCP
