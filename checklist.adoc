= Security Checklist
:reproducible:

This document contains a security checklist for running production workloads on an OpenShift platform.

:toc:

== General Security Principles

* Least privilege access
** Identities are only permitted to perform the most minimal set of functions necessary to fulfill a specific task
* Zero trust security
** Application components including microservices are considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice trusts any other
* Defense in depth
** Multiple layers of of security controls are implemented thoughout the system to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited
* Identity foundation for both humans and machines

== Account Management ( Cloud Platform)

* [ ] Seperate workloads by account
** Production workloads should be in a seperate account from development and test workloads
* [ ] ROOT account not used except for initial account setup

== Identity Management (Cloud Platform)

* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per pyhisical person
* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per application
* [ ] One IAM Role per Application
* [ ] IAM credentials are not shared
* [ ] IAM credentials are not in code 
* [ ] ROOT IAM Credentials not used
*	[ ] Strong sign in mechanisms
** [ ] MFA (multi factor authentication) 
* [ ] Use temporary (short lived) credentials when appropriate
** Some examples of when this would be appropriate are:
*** Enterprise Identity Federation
***	Web identity federation
*** Cross account access
* [ ] Rotate credentials periodically
** [ ] For human identities, change passwords periodically 
** [ ] Use temporary credentials when possible instead of access keys
** [ ] For machine identities, use temporary credentials using IAM roles
* [ ] Store and use secrets securely

== Identity Management ( OpenShift)
* [ ] Configure an identity provider
* [ ] Create a cluster admin user
* [ ] Remove kubeadmin user (default OpenShift cluster admin user)
* [ ] One serviceaccount per application
* [ ] default service account is not used

== Permission Management (Cloud Platform)

Enforce least privelage access

* [ ] Identity base policies are specified - specify what the identity (user, group, role) can do
* [ ] Resource based policies – grants permission for a resource to a principal
* [ ] Permission boundary policies – set boundaries on maximum permission that can be set
* [ ] Organization Service Control Policies – defines max permissions at the account organization or organization unit

== Permission Management  (OpenShift)

* [ ] cluser-admin role is not used (except for the principle user who is actually the cluster admin)
** cluster-admin role in OpenShift has permission to perform all actions on all resources in the cluster
* [ ] Use Groups to aggregate users and apply RBAC policies
* [ ] Users have least privelage access
* [ ] ServiceAccounts have least privelage access

== Detection / Observability

* [ ] Detect unexpected and unwanted configuration changes at all levels of the application stack and delivery lifecycle
** Infrastructure
** Services
** Applications
** CI/CD
* [ ] Log account activity
* [ ] Log OpenShift platform activity
** someone deletes a resource, be able to know who did it
* [ ] Log application activity
* [ ] Log CI/CD activity
* [ ] Analyze logs using a SIEM (security information and event management system)
* [ ] Application Performance Monitoring for all workloads and key transactions
** IBM Instana
* [ ] Implement actionable events – runbook or playbook with instructions on how to investigate and remediate the event
* [ ] Automate response to events

== Infrastructure Protection (Cloud Platform)

=== Protect Networks

* [ ] Create network layers (subnets within a VPC) for different components of your application stack (microservices, databases etc)
* [ ] Secure VPC subnets using ACL
* [ ] Secure instances using Security Groups
* [ ] Protect web apps and api’s using a web application firewall
** DDoS
* [ ] Network traffic on private network when possible
* [ ] Minimize the number of holes in the network

== Infrastructure Protection (OpenShift)

=== Protect Networks

TBD
Need to investigate this more

=== OpenShift harding
* [ ] etcd encryption
** etcd stores all the resources in OpenShift including sensitive data such as secrets, encryption can protect this data


== Workload and DevSecOps CI/CD Protection

* [ ] Secure Git Workflow for managing application code changes
** Branch protection
** Pull request approvals
* [ ] Secure Git Workflow for managing GitOps changes
** Branch protection
** Pull request approvals
* [ ] Implement in the CI/CD pipeline a combination of manual and automated security gates for promotion to higher environments
* [ ] Implement separation of duties using roles: _developer_, _release manager_, _DevOps engineer_, etc
* [ ] A private registry is used to manage images
* [ ] Restrict registries that can be used for pulling images to only authorized/approved ones
* [ ] Build images from code repo and store in the private image repository
* [ ] Ensure logging is enabled from CI/CD process, which shall be preserved for monitoring and for evidence
* [ ] Perform vulnerability management 
** [ ] Code dependencies
** [ ] Container image scanning
** [ ] Virtual machines
* [ ] Perform static code analysis to eliminate code vulnerabilities
** SonarQube is a popular static code analysis tool
* [ ] Reduce attack surface (reduce exposure to unintended access)
** [ ] Minimal OS with only required packages installed
** [ ] Eliminate any code dependencies that are not used
** [ ] Remove code no longer needed
* [ ] Use managed services when possible (this probably is not strategic for cloud paks???)
** In the shared responsibility model, the cloud provider is responsible for patches and any security fixes
* [ ] Validate software integrity
** [ ] Digitally sign container images
** [ ] Validate container image digital signatures before allowing them to run
** [ ] Validate code signing certificates of binaries and scripts to confirm the author and ensure it has not been tampered with.
* [ ]  Application/microservice logging
** [ ] Do not log sensitive information (PCI, PII etc)
** [ ] Send all logs to SIEM for analysis
* [ ] Pen testing to validate application security
* [ ] Store and use secrets securely
** Sealed secrets in OpenShift encrypts secrets and decrepts them when applied in the cluster
** IBM Cloud Secrets Manager
** AWS Secrets Manager
** Hashicorp Vault
* [ ] Protect microservices from aunauthorized access
** Use Oauth2 and Open ID Connect technology
** Access tokens for access, ID tokens to identify the user (these tokens are typically JWT)



== Data Protection

=== Protect Data in Transit

* [ ] Implement secure key and certificate management
** Store encryption keys and certificates securely and roteate them at appropriate intervals with strict access control.
** Some solutions are: Cert Manager, IBM Key Protect etc
* [ ] Enforce encryption in transit for network traffic internal to cluster
** use HTTPS endpoints using TLS
** application code can implement this
** alternatively a service mesh such as OpenShift Service Mesh (Istio) can enforce this
** use mutual TLS (mTLS) when appropriate
* [ ] Enforce encryption in transit for network traffic entering the cluster
** Routes/Ingress configured with HTTPS using TLS

=== Protect Data at Rest

* TODO


== Notes:

Cloud Platforms are IBM Cloud, AWS, Azure, GCP
