= Security Checklist
:reproducible:

This document contains a security checklist.

== General Security Principles

* Least privilege access
** Identities are only permitted to perform the most minimal set of functions necessary to fulfill a specific task
* Zero trust security
** Application components including microservices are considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice trusts any other
* Defense in depth
** Multiple layers of of security controls are implemented thoughout the system to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited
* Identity foundation for both humans and machines
** TODO - ### description ###

== Account Management ( Cloud Privider such as IBM, AWS, Azure, GCP etc)

== Identity Management 

* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per pyhisical person
* [ ] One IAM User/Identity per application
** [ ] Service accounts in kubernetes
* [ ]	One IAM Role per Application
* [ ]	IAM credentials are not shared
* [ ]	IAM credentials are not in code 
* [ ]	ROOT account not used except for initial account setup
* [ ]	ROOT IAM Credentials not used
â€¢	[ ] Strong sign in mechanisms
** [ ]	MFA (multi factor authentication) 
* [ ]	Use temporary (short lived) credentials when appropriate
** Enterprise Identity Federation
**	Web identity federation
** Cross account access
* [ ]	Rotate credentials periodically
** [ ] For human identities, change passwords periodically 
** [ ] Use temporary credentials when possible instead of access keys
** [ ] For machine identities, use temporary credentials using IAM roles
* [ ]	Store and use secrets securely

* [*] checked
** [ ] also checked
* [ ] not checked
